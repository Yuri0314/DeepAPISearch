javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIClientSocketFactory#createSocket(String, int)->Socket:::Creates an SSL socket.  If the system property javax.rmi.ssl.client.enabledCipherSuites is specified, this method will call SSLSocket#setEnabledCipherSuites(String[]) before returning the socket
javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIClientSocketFactory#equals(Object)->boolean:::Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.  Because all instances of this class are functionally equivalent (they all use the default SSLSocketFactory), this method simply returns this.getClass().equals(obj.getClass()).  A subclass should override this method (as well as #hashCode()) if its instances are not all functionally equivalent.
javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIClientSocketFactory#hashCode()->int:::Returns a hash code value for this SslRMIClientSocketFactory.
javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIServerSocketFactory#getEnabledCipherSuites()->String[]:::Returns the names of the cipher suites enabled on SSL connections accepted by server sockets created by this factory, or null if this factory uses the cipher suites that are enabled by default.
javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIServerSocketFactory#getEnabledProtocols()->String[]:::Returns the names of the protocol versions enabled on SSL connections accepted by server sockets created by this factory, or null if this factory uses the protocol versions that are enabled by default.
javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIServerSocketFactory#getNeedClientAuth()->boolean:::Returns true if client authentication is required on SSL connections accepted by server sockets created by this factory.
javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIServerSocketFactory#createServerSocket(int)->ServerSocket:::Creates a server socket that accepts SSL connections configured according to this factory's SSL socket configuration parameters.
javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIServerSocketFactory#equals(Object)->boolean:::Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.  Two SslRMIServerSocketFactory objects are equal if they have been constructed with the same SSL context and SSL socket configuration parameters.  A subclass should override this method (as well as #hashCode()) if it adds instance state that affects equality.
javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIServerSocketFactory#hashCode()->int:::Returns a hash code value for this SslRMIServerSocketFactory.
