Annotation#equals(Object):::Returns true if the specified object represents an annotation that is logically equivalent to this one:::
Annotation#hashCode():::Returns the hash code of this annotation, as defined below:  The hash code of an annotation is the sum of the hash codes of its members (including those with default values), as defined below:  The hash code of an annotation member is (127 times the hash code of the member-name as computed by String#hashCode()) XOR the hash code of the member-value, as defined below:  The hash code of a member-value depends on its type: <ul> <li>The hash code of a primitive value v is equal to     WrapperType.valueOf(v).hashCode(), where     WrapperType is the wrapper type corresponding     to the primitive type of v (Byte,     Character, Double, Float, Integer,     Long, Short, or Boolean):::
Annotation#toString():::Returns a string representation of this annotation:::
Annotation#annotationType():::Returns the annotation type of this annotation.:::
AnnotationTypeMismatchException#element():::Returns the Method object for the incorrectly typed element:::return
AnnotationTypeMismatchException#foundType():::Returns the type of data found in the incorrectly typed element:::return
IncompleteAnnotationException#annotationType():::Returns the Class object for the annotation type with the missing element.:::return
IncompleteAnnotationException#elementName():::Returns the name of the missing element.:::return
