Canonicalizable#canonical(CanonicalizerTool):::Implementations of this method can provide local optimizations like constant folding and strength reduction:::
Canonicalizable.Unary#canonical(CanonicalizerTool, T):::Similar to Canonicalizable#canonical(CanonicalizerTool), except that implementations should act as if the current input of the node was the given one, i.e., they should never look at the inputs via the this pointer.:::
Canonicalizable.Unary#getValue():::Gets the current value of the input, so that calling #canonical(CanonicalizerTool, Node) with the value returned from this method should behave exactly like Canonicalizable#canonical(CanonicalizerTool).:::
Canonicalizable.Binary#canonical(CanonicalizerTool, T, T):::Similar to Canonicalizable#canonical(CanonicalizerTool), except that implementations should act as if the current input of the node was the given one, i.e., they should never look at the inputs via the this pointer.:::
Canonicalizable.Binary#getX():::Gets the current value of the input, so that calling #canonical(CanonicalizerTool, Node, Node) with the value returned from this method should behave exactly like Canonicalizable#canonical(CanonicalizerTool).:::
Canonicalizable.Binary#getY():::Gets the current value of the input, so that calling #canonical(CanonicalizerTool, Node, Node) with the value returned from this method should behave exactly like Canonicalizable#canonical(CanonicalizerTool).:::
Canonicalizable.BinaryCommutative#maybeCommuteInputs():::Ensure a canonical ordering of inputs for commutative nodes to improve GVN results:::
Canonicalizable.Ternary#canonical(CanonicalizerTool, T, T, T):::Similar to Canonicalizable#canonical(CanonicalizerTool), except that implementations should act as if the current input of the node was the given one, i.e., they should never look at the inputs via the this pointer.:::
Canonicalizable.Ternary#getX():::Gets the current value of the input, so that calling #canonical(CanonicalizerTool, Node, Node, Node) with the value returned from this method should behave exactly like Canonicalizable#canonical(CanonicalizerTool).:::
Canonicalizable.Ternary#getY():::Gets the current value of the input, so that calling #canonical(CanonicalizerTool, Node, Node, Node) with the value returned from this method should behave exactly like Canonicalizable#canonical(CanonicalizerTool).:::
Canonicalizable.Ternary#getZ():::Gets the current value of the input, so that calling #canonical(CanonicalizerTool, Node, Node, Node) with the value returned from this method should behave exactly like Canonicalizable#canonical(CanonicalizerTool).:::
CanonicalizerTool#allUsagesAvailable():::If this method returns false, not all Node#usages() usages of a node are yet available:::
CanonicalizerTool#smallestCompareWidth():::Indicates the smallest width for comparing an integer value on the target platform:::
SimplifierTool#addToWorkList(Node):::Adds a node to the worklist independent of whether it has already been on the worklist.:::
